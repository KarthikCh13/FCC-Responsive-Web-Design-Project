          The German company <code>Telefunken</code> published on their early
          ball mouse on 2 October 1968. Telefunken's mouse was sold as optional
          equipment for their computer systems. Bill English, builder of
          Engelbart's original mouse, created a ball mouse in 1972 while working
          for Xerox PARC. <br />
          <br />
          The ball mouse replaced the external wheels with a single ball that
          could rotate in any direction. It came as part of the hardware package
          of the Xerox Alto computer. Perpendicular chopper wheels housed inside
          the mouse's body chopped beams of light on the way to light sensors,
          thus detecting in their turn the motion of the ball. This variant of
          the mouse resembled an inverted trackball and became the predominant
          form used with personal computers throughout the 1980s and 1990s. The
          Xerox PARC group also settled on the modern technique of using both
          hands to type on a full-size keyboard and grabbing the mouse when
          required.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ball mouse has two freely rotating rollers. These are located 90
          degrees apart. One roller detects the forward–backward motion of the
          mouse and other the left-right motion. Opposite the two rollers is a
          third one (white, in the photo, at 45 degrees) that is spring-loaded
          to push the ball against the other two rollers. Each roller is on the
          same shaft as an encoder wheel that has slotted edges; the slots
          interrupt infrared light beams to generate electrical pulses that
          represent wheel movement. Each wheel's disc has a pair of light beams,
          located so that a given beam becomes interrupted or again starts to
          pass light freely when the other beam of the pair is about halfway
          between changes. Simple logic circuits interpret the relative timing
          to indicate which direction the wheel is rotating.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another type of mechanical mouse, the "analog mouse" (now generally
          regarded as obsolete), uses potentiometers rather than encoder wheels,
          and is typically designed to be plug compatible with an analog
          joystick. The "Color Mouse", originally marketed by RadioShack for
          their Color Computer (but also usable on MS-DOS machines equipped with
          analog joystick ports, provided the software accepted joystick input)
          was the best-known example.

        <p>
          An optical mouse is a computer mouse which uses a light source,
          typically a light-emitting diode (LED), and a light detector, such as
          an array of photodiodes, to detect movement relative to a surface.
          Variations of the optical mouse have largely replaced the older
          mechanical mouse design, which uses moving parts to sense motion. The
          earliest optical mice detected movement on pre-printed mousepad
          surfaces. Modern optical mice work on most opaque diffusely reflective
          surfaces like paper, but most of them do not work properly on
          specularly reflective surfaces like polished stone or transparent
          surfaces like glass. Optical mice that use dark field illumination can
          function reliably even on such surfaces.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first two optical mice, first demonstrated by two independent
          inventors in December 1980, had different basic designs: One of these,
          invented by
          <code>Kirsch of MIT and Mouse Systems Corporation</code> Kirsch of MIT
          and Mouse Systems Corporation, used an infrared LED and a
          four-quadrant infrared sensor to detect grid lines printed with
          infrared absorbing ink on a special metallic surface. Predictive
          algorithms in the CPU of the mouse calculated the speed and direction
          over the grid. The other type, invented by Richard F. Lyon of Xerox,
          used a 16-pixel visible-light image sensor with integrated motion
          detection on the same n-type (5 µm) MOS integrated circuit chip, and
          tracked the motion of light dots in a dark field of a printed paper or
          similar mouse pad. The Kirsch and Lyon mouse types had very different
          behaviors, as the Kirsch mouse used an x-y coordinate system embedded
          in the pad, and would not work correctly when the pad was rotated,
          while the Lyon mouse used the x-y coordinate system of the mouse body,
          as mechanical mice do.

        <p>
          Often called "air mice" since they do not require a surface to
          operate, inertial mice use a tuning fork or other accelerometer to
          detect rotary movement for every axis supported. The most common
          models, manufactured by <code>Logitech and Gyration</code> work using
          2 degrees of rotational freedom and are insensitive to spatial
          translation. The user requires only small wrist rotations to move the
          cursor, reducing user fatigue or "gorilla arm".
        </p>
        <p>
          Usually cordless, they often have a switch to deactivate the movement
          circuitry between use, allowing the user freedom of movement without
          affecting the cursor position. A patent for an inertial mouse claims
          that such mice consume less power than optically based mice, and offer
          increased sensitivity, reduced weight and increased ease-of-use.[67]
          In combination with a wireless keyboard an inertial mouse can offer
          alternative ergonomic arrangements which do not require a flat work
          surface, potentially alleviating some types of repetitive motion
          injuries related to workstation posture.

          As the name suggests, this type of mouse is intended to provide
          optimum comfort and avoid injuries such as carpal tunnel syndrome,
          arthritis, and other repetitive strain injuries. It is designed to fit
          natural hand position and movements, to reduce discomfort.
        </p>
        <p>
          When holding a typical mouse, the ulna and radius bones on the arm are
          crossed. Some designs attempt to place the palm more vertically, so
          the bones take more natural parallel position. Some limit wrist
          movement, encouraging arm movement instead, that may be less precise
          but more optimal from the health point of view. A mouse may be angled
          from the thumb downward to the opposite side – this is known to reduce
          wrist pronation. However such optimizations make the mouse right or
          left hand specific, making more problematic to change the tired hand.
          <code>Time</code> has criticized manufacturers for offering few or no
          left-handed ergonomic mice: "Oftentimes I felt like I was dealing with
          someone who’d never actually met a left-handed person before."
        </p>
        <p>
          Another solution is a pointing bar device. The so-called roller bar
          mouse is positioned snugly in front of the keyboard, thus allowing
          bi-manual accessibility.

          These mice are specifically designed for use in
          <code>computer games</code>. They typically employ a wider array of
          controls and buttons and have designs that differ radically from
          traditional mice. They may also have decorative monochrome or
          programmable RGB LED lighting. The additional buttons can often be
          used for changing the sensitivity of the mouse or they can be assigned
          (programmed) to macros (i.e., for opening a program or for use instead
          of a key combination). It is also common for game mice, especially
          those designed for use in real-time strategy games such as StarCraft,
          or in multiplayer online battle arena games such as Dota 2 to have a
          relatively high sensitivity, measured in dots per inch (DPI), which
          can be as high as 25,600.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some advanced mice from gaming manufacturers also allow users to
          adjust the weight of the mouse by adding or subtracting weights to
          allow for easier control. Ergonomic quality is also an important
          factor in gaming mice, as extended gameplay times may render further
          use of the mouse to be uncomfortable. Some mice have been designed to
          have adjustable features such as removable and/or elongated palm
          rests, horizontally adjustable thumb rests and pinky rests. Some mice
          may include several different rests with their products to ensure
          comfort for a wider range of target consumers.
